Background on the estuary

* big picture things: location, size of stuff *

The Pescadero estuary is located at the confluence of Pescadero Creek and Butano Creek in southern San Mateo County on the California coast. The estuary drains a watershed of XXX km^2 of the Santa Cruz mountains, located in California's coastal range. The coastal range has a rainfall dominated hydrology, and freshwater streamflow on the creeks is flashy and seasonal.

A - Historical Context
A history of the Pescadero {estuary?} was compiled as the dissertation work of [Italian sounding last name, 1977]. 


B - Current problems (fish kills?)

C - The scope of what I can say. (and maybe some disclaimers on what I can't). 


--------------------------------------
Our observations:

Field measurements were taken in the Pescadero estuary during X field deployments. 

1 - March - May 2010
2 - September 2010
3 - November 2010 - May or June 2011
4 - August 2011 - June 5, 2012
5 - October 2012 (but not really)

Later deployments utilized more instruments and thus had better resolution in space.  The frequency of measurements was also increased in later deployments with the realization that infragravity forcing was present.

Conditions during these three years:

The years 2010-2012 encompassed [? El ninho, la ninha, drought].

* Tidal conditions and how they are measured.
* Streamflow conditions and how they are measured.

Freshwater streamflow into the Pescadero estuary is estimated based on a United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauge located on Pescadero Creek [X km] upstream from the mouth of the estuary (USGS ########). This gauge records water height and calculates freshwater discharge every [X min]. The gauge is downstream of [X] % of the watershed, so to estimate freshwater flow into the estuary the gauged discharge measurement is multiplied by [X = 1.76, eu acho]. Unaccounted for freshwater diversions are thought to exist downstream of the gauge which likely reduce freshwater flow into the estuary, however we do not have a way to quantify these diversions and thus will report freshwater flow as if they do not exist.

The Mediterranean climate of California [comes with] seasonal precipitation. [X] % of coastal California's [X cm] of annual precipitation falls between the months of [X and X], and freshwater flow in the Pescadero Creek follows this trend. [Insert Figure: Q vs. t for all t (median) and 2010- 2012 overlaid]. 

Ocean wave conditions are obtained through the National Oceanic and Atmopheric Administration (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). NDBC buoy 46012 is located approximately 40 km WNW of the Pescadero estuary in 208.8? m of water. This buoy reports ocean significant wave height ever [X min]. [Note on deep water vs. coastal]. Maximum wave heights in the ocean from 2010 - 2012 were [X m], and minimum were [X m], while the range of ocean significant wave heights while our sensors were recording in the Pescadero estuary was [X m to X m]. 

Furthermore, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake generated a Pacific Ocean-wide tsunami (also known as a teletsunami). A description of the Pescadero estuary's response to the forcing of the small amplitude tsunami that reached California is found in Chapter 5. 


-------------------------------------

With these observations, we have identified two main conditions for the estaury: open and closed.  The inlet continuously contracts and [gets bigger] with nearshore sand transport. Within the open state, tides in the estuary may be an attenuated version of the ocean tides [Figure], and this state we will consider to be fully open. An extensive description of relevant hydrodynamic and salt transport processes in the fully open state is found in Chapter 3. 

Because the estuarine inlet is in a constantly unstable condition, an intermediate state between fully open and closed is also common in the Pescadero estuary.  In this state, the sandy inlet is constricted, probably due to accretion of sand at the bed of the inlet. Here, the estuarine water level rises and falls in response to ocean tides, but may only fill with the diurnal high high tide [Figure] or be severly attenuated [Figure]. We consider this condition to be a highly-constricted open state. 

The closed state of the estuary is characterized by tidal depth oscillations being shut off. This does not mean that the ocean tides cease to influence water level in the estuary but that the water is not outflowing through the channel. Variation in forcing within the closed state depends on length of closure, to be discussed in section {X}. 

Transitions between these two states are rapid. 

[A note on closure.] 

And, the transition from the closed state to open state in the Pescadero estuary naturally occurs only when increased freshwater streamflow overtops the sand bar at the mouth. It has been suggested in other estuaries that storm waves overtopping the bar may breach the estuary from the ocean side [CITE], but the mouth of the Pescadero estuary is somewhat protected by the southern end cliff, and wave conditions observed during our years of study make this unlikely. Given a storm surge similar to that carried by Superstorm Sandy which created new inlets in Barnegat Bay [CITE], this could be possible, but these are very unlikely to occur in California's climate.
