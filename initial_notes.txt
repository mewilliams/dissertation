Pescadero chapter:  Thesis chapter two.  Titled, 'hydrodynamics of intermittently closed estuaries from the perspective of the Pescadero estuary'

Information about the Pescadero estuary: 
- watershed size
- history
- closure

- general description of observations made. 
- weather, waves during observations. La Ninha, El ninho, drought

Three sections: Closed, Open, Breach, Closure?

Closed estuary:
Waves overtop sandbar to deliver more salt water. 
Also to deliver sediment to the berm. 
Mixing is wind-driven, example of event.
Details of how that happens - upwelling of water. 


Open estuary: 
Details to follow in chapters 3, 4, 5.
"Open" is a continuum.  
Variation in tidal state. 
Mouth perched above MLLW. 


Breaching estuary: 
Looking at measurements in lower estuary - either freshwater flows out, or mixing occurs. Can I tie that back to any reasoning?


Closure: 
Can comment that after closure (at least in the summer), lagoon infilling is by the ocean. 



What would I want managers to know about this estuary? What do I know that isn't obvious or general?
