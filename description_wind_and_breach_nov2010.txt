An observed example of wind setup and mixing occurred just prior to the sand bar breach on November 24, 2010. In situ velocity and salinity measurements combined with wind measurements at Half Moon Bay airport are used to understand this event:

On November 23, wind forcing was seaward, small surface velocities in the Pescadero estuary were consistent with this forcing, and the water column was vertically stratified.
